# Exercise: Database operations with MongoDB and MySQL

## Introduction

In this exercise you will learn basic database operations with MongoDB and MySQL. You will use a MongoDB database and a MySQL database to insert, query, update and delete book data.

## Assignment for MongoDB

You are to create a simple book database using MongoDB and perform various operations on it. Use the MongoDB syntax for the operations.

### Task 1: Inserting books into MongoDB

Create a collection named "books" and insert three books as documents into the collection. Each book should contain fields like `author`, `title`, `genre` and `year`. Use the `insertMany()` method.

### Task 2: Querying books in MongoDB

Find all books that belong to the genre "Science Fiction". Use the `find()` method.

### Task 3: Updating books in MongoDB

Update the author of the first book. Change the value of the `author' field to `John Doe'. Use the `updateOne()` method.

### Task 4: Deleting books in MongoDB

Delete the third book from the collection. Use the `deleteOne()` method.

## Task for MySQL

You are to create a simple book database using MySQL and perform various operations on it. Use the MySQL syntax for the operations.

### Task 5: Inserting books in MySQL

Create a table named "books" and insert three books as records into the table. Each book should contain fields like `author`, `title`, `genre` and `year`. Use the syntax `INSERT INTO` and `VALUES`.

### Task 6: Querying books in MySQL

Find all books that belong to the genre "Science Fiction". Use the syntax `SELECT * FROM` and `WHERE`.

### Task 7: Updating books in MySQL

Update the author of the first book. Change the value of the `Author` field to `John Doe`. Use the `UPDATE` and `SET` syntax.

### Task 8: Deleting books in MySQL

Delete the third book from the table. Use the syntax `DELETE FROM` and `WHERE`.
